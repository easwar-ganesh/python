PYTHON COLLECTIONS (Arrays)
    In Python, Collections are used to store group  of data with similar or multiple data types
The four collection data types in the Python programming language are:
1.List
2.Tuple
3.Set
4.Dictinary

    1.LIST :
            List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
        Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Declaration and Accessing :
       Ex1: 
             thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
             print(thislist)

       Ex2:  
             list1 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
             list2 = [True, False, False]
             list3 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
Accessing:
      Ex3:
              thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
              print(thislist[2:5])  '''HERE THE INDEX 2 IS INCLUDED AND INDEX 5 IS EXCLUDED WHEN PRINTING THE OUTPUT'''

      Ex4:
              thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
              print(thislist[:4])    '''PRINTS THE ELEMENTS FROM BEGINING AND ENDS WITH INDEX 3'''

    2.TUPLE : 
                Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
            Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
            Tuples are written with round brackets.

Declaration and Accessing :
              thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
              print(thistuple)

          Ex1:
                thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
                print(thistuple[2:5])
                """Here the element with index 2 is included and the elemeent with index 5 is excluded while printing the output"""

          Ex2:
                thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
                print(thistuple[:4])
              """PRINTS THE ELEMENTS FROM INDEX 0 TO 3"""

    3.SET : 
            Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.

  Declaration and Accessing :
              thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
              print(thisset)
            """ Note: the set list is unordered, Meaning: the items will appear in a random order."""  
          Ex1 :
              thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
              for x in thisset:
              print(x)
          Ex2:
  4.Dictionary:
            Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

Declaration and Accessing :
            Ex1 :  thisdict = {
                          "brand": "Ford",
                          "model": "Mustang",
                          "year": 1964
                          }
                    print(thisdict)

            Ex2:
                  thisdict = {
                              "brand": "Ford",
                              "model": "Mustang",
                              "year": 1964
                            }
                print(thisdict["brand"])
